This course will teach fundamentals of control design and analysis using state-space methods. This includes both the practical and theoretical aspects of the topic. By the end of the course, you should be able to design controllers using state-space methods and evaluate whether these controllers are robust to some types of modeling errors and nonlinearities. You will learn to:

*   Design controllers using state-space methods and analyze using classical tools.
*   Understand impact of implementation issues (nonlinearity, delay).
*   Indicate the robustness of your control design.
*   Linearize a nonlinear system, and analyze stability.
